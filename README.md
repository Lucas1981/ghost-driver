# Ghost Driver

I had an itch to make something again. I started out in Rust. But Rust kinda sucks so far, imho. So I went with C++. I got a car and opponent cars going. I then figured oh wait, that means he's driving against the grain, so in Dutch that's a ghost driver. Great title!

My challenge was to have a scrolling background. The objective will be pretty simple though: limited time to make it to the finish, every time you crash into a car it will slow you down. Crash too many times and you won't make it on time.
